# Top Paying Jobs and Most Optimal Skills For Data/Business Analysts In Canada

## Introduction
The main objective of this project is to guide and inform aspiring data and business analysts in Canada, including myself, on the job titles available as well as the corresponding companies and top salaries offered for those roles.

From there, we can move forward to understand the specific skills that are required and in demand for those jobs in data analyst and business analyst roles, such as SQL, Power BI, Python, Azure, AWS and more. 

Furthermore, we aim to explore which of these skills may result in higher average salaries and, given the salary, which skills are most optimal to learn in order to be successful as a data or business analyst.
